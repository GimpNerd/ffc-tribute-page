            <p><strong>Homer Jay Simpson</strong> is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the American
                animated sitcom The Simpsons. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared on television, along
                with the rest of his family, in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Homer was
                created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks'
                office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip Life in Hell but
                instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer
                Groening. After appearing for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, the Simpson family got their own
                series on Fox that debuted December 17, 1989.</p>

            <p>As the patriarch of the eponymous family, Homer and his wife Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa and
                Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector.
                Homer embodies many American working class stereotypes: he is crude, obese, incompetent, lazy, clumsy,
                dim-witted, hot-tempered, childish and addicted to alcohol, junk food and watching television. However,
                he often does his best to be a decent man and is fiercely devoted to his family, especially when his
                wife and children need him the most. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a
                number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in
                Springfield by himself, fighting former President George H. W. Bush and winning a Grammy Award as a
                member of a barbershop quartet.</p>

            <p>In the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of Walter Matthau;
                however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become
                more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media
                relating to The Simpsons—including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials, and
                comic books—and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt
                "D'oh!", has been included in The New Oxford Dictionary of English since 1998 and the Oxford English
                Dictionary since 2001.</p>

            <p></p>Homer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television, and is widely
            considered to be an American cultural icon. The British newspaper The Sunday Times described him as "the
            greatest comic creation of [modern] time". He was named the greatest character "of the last 20 years" in
            2010 by Entertainment Weekly, was ranked the second-greatest cartoon character by TV Guide, behind Bugs
            Bunny, and was voted the greatest television character of all time by Channel 4 viewers. For voicing Homer,
            Castellaneta has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance and a
            special-achievement Annie Award. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of
            Fame.</p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Simpson" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">More...</a>
